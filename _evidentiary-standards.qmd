### Evidentiary standards

When thinking about p-values and thresholds, I like to imagine myself as a judge or a member of a jury. Many legal systems around the world have formal evidentiary thresholds or standards of proof. If prosecutors provide evidence that meets a threshold (i.e. goes beyond a reasonable doubt, or shows evidence on a balance of probabilities), the judge or jury can rule *guilty*. If there's not enough evidence to clear the standard or threshold, the judge or jury has to rule *not guilty*.

With p-values:

- If the probability of seeing an effect or difference (or δ) in a null world is less than 5% (or whatever the threshold is), we rule it *statistically significant* and say that the difference does not fit in that world. **We're pretty confident that it's not zero.**
- If the p-value is larger than the threshold, we do not have enough evidence to claim that δ doesn't come from a world of where there's no difference. **We don't know if it's not zero.**

Importantly, *if the difference is not significant, that does not mean that there is no difference*. **It just means that we can't detect one if there is**. If a prosecutor doesn't provide sufficient evidence to clear a standard or threshold, it does not mean that the defendant didn't do whatever they're charged with\*—it means that the judge or jury can't detect guilt.

\* Kind of—in common law systems, defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, so if there's not enough evidence to prove guilt, they are innocent by definition.

#### Different evidentiary standards

Many legal systems have different levels of evidentiary standards:

- Standards of proof in most common law systems (juries): [<i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>](https://righttoremain.org.uk/what-are-the-different-standards-and-burdens-of-proof-in-legal-cases/) [<i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>](https://www.bljsolicitors.co.uk/blog/understanding-the-standard-of-proof-in-criminal-cases/)
  - Balance of probabilities (civil cases)
  - Beyond a reasonable doubt (criminal cases)

- Evidentiary thresholds in the United States (juries): [<i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/burden_of_proof)
