## There is only one test

All hypothesis tests follow the same workflow:

https://moderndive.com/v2/hypothesis-testing.html#ht-case-study - This workflow allows you to test any statistical hypothesis through simulation by following this process for the idea that there is only one statistical test:

- **Step 1: Calculate a sample statistic, or $\delta$.** This is the main measure you care about: the difference in means, the average, the median, the proportion, the difference in proportions, the chi-squared value, etc.
- **Step 2: Use simulation to invent a world where $\delta$ is null.** Simulate what the world would look like if there was no difference between two groups, or if there was no difference in proportions, or where the average value is a specific number.
- **Step 3: Look at $\delta$ in the null world.** Put the sample statistic in the null world and see if it fits well.
- **Step 4: Calculate the probability that $\delta$ could exist in null world.** This is the p-value, or the probability that you'd see a $\delta$ at least that high in a world where there's no difference.
- **Step 5: Decide if $\delta$ is statistically significant.** Choose some evidentiary standard or threshold for deciding if there's sufficient proof for rejecting the null world. Standard thresholds (from least to most rigorous) are 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01.

## Examples

- [Difference in Means](diff-in-means.qmd)
- [Difference in Proportions](diff-in-props.qmd)
- [Regression Slope](regression.qmd)
- [One-Sample Mean](one-sample-mean.qmd)
- [Theoretical P-values](regular-p-values.qmd)
